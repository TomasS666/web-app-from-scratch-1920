# Description
This project contains a Webapp made with Vanilla Javascript with the exception of a micro library which manages the hashrouting. The learning goal here is to make the webapp myself without the use of any frameworks and to challenge myself to build functionality I haven't worked with yet.

## How to install
This webapp is completely client-side. But for bundling and transpiling ES6 code to ES5. I use parcel as a bundler, but feel free to use another bundler instead.

To install this webapp, you only have to clone this repository by entering the following command in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/TomasS666/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git```

or this command if you want to clone the repo into your current folder:

```git clone https://github.com/TomasS666/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git ./```

or you can download the zip file or something similar by clicking on the green button on the top-right position of every repo.


## Concept
The concept of this website is quite straightforward, the idea is to enable the user to browse and explore information about movies. 
It would have been nice to also offer them information about movies which are in theaters now, but that's a nice addition when there's time left over.

## Interaction diagram

## API TheMovieDB
I'm fetching data on the following endpoints:

To get a list of movies of a certain genre:
```
/discover/with_genre={id}
```

### Used data
I'm fetching movies by genre. Within the render of the genres with movies I apply a ```#movie/{id}``` to anchors around the movie wrapper. When the user clicks on a movie, my routie takes the id param and uses it to fetch the movie data itself. With that data I render a detail-page with it's own sub components.

## Data manipulation

### Guide

### Limit
The rate limit has been removed. Yet after some time I retrieved the data of a genre and I saved it locally temporarily so I wouldn't overload the server of such a nice company. 

## Features
Searching movies
Overview page of movie genres
Single page detail page

## Wishlist
* Preload skeleton layout. Image reflow.
* Keeping track of history / hashes to enable the user to pick up where they left of.
* Search results view
* Better flow of data
* Less cascading functional code, more human readable code ( export functions in a covering parent object )
* More readable way for creating components.

## Future features
I've gotten in to the shadow dom way too late, but better late than never. I was very eager to apply this system with actual webcomponents into my web-app, but due time I have to keep my hands of it and finish the foundation I've been working on.

## Proces
### CreateAndAppend
For creating my own templating engine I choose createElement() and append() over insertAdjacentHTML first because with innerAdjacentHTML you have to retrieve the DOM element again before you can add eventlisteners. 
But since the template became bigger and I realized of course I don't have to put events on everything I started using a mix of both innerAdjacdntHTML with template literals and createAndAppend().

But, as you can imagine, my ```createAndAppend()``` can look a little overwhelming and might make it less readable. Although some disagree and think it's quite nice in my use case.

This approach of using both my own ```createAndAppend()``` and template literals for static components made me think a lot. Maybe too much. I wanted a better way to render my components client-side. There is a way, and [Joost](https://github.com/joostf) introduced [Webcomponents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) to me. This was the thing I wanted to learn all along, but I've been coping with it too much. So right now I'm staying with my original approach and I hope I can introduce this advanced approach in my next project. It's a hard lesson to learn, but I've learned it anyway and that's my takeaway from this course.
